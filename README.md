# survey_data_analysis

To create data of a survey taken I used Python's Faker library to create mock_data.xlsx.This represents a sample of suurvey data taken over the period 2000 to the year 2020.
The data is then Cleaned and Standardized using Python's Pandas library.
This dataframe is then saved as survey_data.xlsx.

Survey results taken from 5 different regions.
Participants needed to select an answer that had 10 possible answers.
The 50 respondents were selected from random companies in those 5 regions. 

Data visualization is done using PowerBI.
By analyzing the data, I was able to construct the following visualizations which can be filtered per region to provide further details:

* the distinct count of participants per region
* the distinct count of companies per region
* count of respones received during the period of the year 2000 - 2020 on a line chart.
* The count of sent surveys versus the amount of responses received.
* The distinct number of answers (1-10) received per region. With this information one can analyze which is the most common answer (1-10) in a specified region.
